# MacGyver

    This game is quite simple, you have to help Mac Gyver to collecte the three objects, 
a needle a tube and an ether bottle to build a seryngue in order to sedate the Gard and 
escape the Maze. If you dare to meet him without the seryngue full of ether, you lose.
You start the game with the python command in the terminal : Python game.py
And you close it just by pressing the cross on the right top of the window.

The game is separated in three files for more clarity : 
    _ "game.py" in wich the game is running
    _ "maze.py" in wich I puted the structure and the building of the maze in order to
        modify it more easily if it's necesary in the futur.
    _ "ressource" in this folder I puted all graphic items. They can be changed,
        just be carrefull to respect the size of 40 pixels by 40 to avoid unexpected collisions.
